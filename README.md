# Telco Customer Churn Potfolio Project

<p align="justify">Churn is when customers stop using the services of a company. Thus, churn prediction identifies customers who are likely to cancel their contracts. If the company can predict that, they can offer discounts on these services to keep the customers. To predict churn, I will use machine learning. For creating a machine learning model, I will use data about customers who churned from Kaggle. Based on that, I will make a model for identifying present customers who are about to churn.</p>
